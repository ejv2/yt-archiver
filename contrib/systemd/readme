yt-archiver - systemd support
=============================

Included are a couple of init scripts for the systemd init system which start
the archiver daemon and accompanied web interface. They assume that they are
placed in the following locations:

	ytarchiver => /usr/bin/
	ytarchiver-web => /var/lib/ytarchiver/	
		(along with all the gohtml files in cmd/ytarchiver-web/)
	ytarchiver.json => /etc/

Place these files in the expected location and everything should work out of the
box.
